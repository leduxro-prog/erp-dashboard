# Canvas Design Skill Overview

This skill enables creation of high-quality visual art (.png and .pdf) grounded in design philosophy rather than templates.

## Core Process

**Two-step workflow:**
1. Develop a visual philosophy (aesthetic movement articulated in .md)
2. Express it visually on canvas (.pdf or .png)

## Key Principles

The philosophy emphasizes that "text is sparse, essential-only, integrated as visual element" and that final work should appear "meticulously crafted" through "painstaking attention" at "master-level execution."

**Visual communication dominates:** Ideas manifest through form, space, color, composition, and spatial hierarchy—not explanatory text. Typography remains minimal and design-forward.

**Craftsmanship emphasis:** The work must demonstrate expertise suggesting "countless hours" of refinement, suitable for museum or magazine display. Every detail—spacing, alignment, color choices—reflects expert-level precision.

**Creative autonomy:** The philosophy provides aesthetic direction while leaving interpretive space for sophisticated visual choices.

## Output Requirements

- Single highly visual page (unless multi-page requested)
- Limited, intentional color palette
- Sparse, clinically-placed typography
- Perfect margins; no overlapping elements
- Museum-quality presentation
- Original designs only (no copyright violations)

The skill treats design as fine art, not decoration—using systematic visual language to express ephemeral concepts with analytical rigor.
