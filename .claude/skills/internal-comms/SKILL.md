# Internal Communications Skill Summary

This skill helps you craft internal company communications using standardized formats. Here's what it covers:

**Communication Types Supported:**
The skill handles "3P updates (Progress, Plans, Problems) team updates," "company-wide newsletters," FAQ responses, status reports, leadership updates, project updates, and incident reports.

**How It Works:**
The process involves three steps: first, identify what type of communication you need; second, locate the matching guideline from the examples directory; and third, follow the formatting and tone instructions provided in that specific file.

**Available Templates:**
Four main guideline files are available—one for 3P updates, one for company newsletters, one for FAQ responses, and a general communications guide for other internal messaging needs.

The skill is designed to ensure consistency across your organization's internal communications by providing company-specific formatting standards and best practices for each communication type.
