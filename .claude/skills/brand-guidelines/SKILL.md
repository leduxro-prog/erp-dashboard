# Anthropic Brand Guidelines Summary

This resource provides Anthropic's official brand identity framework for styling artifacts and designs.

## Key Color Palette

The guidelines specify a cohesive color system:
- **Neutrals**: Dark (#141413), Light (#faf9f5), and grayscale options for backgrounds and text
- **Accents**: Orange (#d97757), Blue (#6a9bcc), and Green (#788c5d) for visual emphasis

## Typography Standards

The brand uses two primary typefaces: "Poppins (with Arial fallback)" for headings and "Lora (with Georgia fallback)" for body text. The system intelligently applies these based on content hierarchy and font availability.

## Implementation Approach

The skill applies Anthropic's visual identity through smart automation—applying appropriate fonts to different text levels, selecting colors based on context, and cycling through accent colors for design elements. The system works with pre-installed fonts and automatically falls back to standard alternatives if needed, ensuring consistent branding across different technical environments.

This makes it useful for projects requiring Anthropic's distinctive look-and-feel without manual design work.
