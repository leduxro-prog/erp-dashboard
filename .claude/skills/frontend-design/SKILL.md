# Frontend Design Skill Summary

This skill enables creation of distinctive, production-grade web interfaces that prioritize authentic design over generic AI aesthetics.

## Key Principles

**Design Process**: Begin by understanding context—purpose, audience, tone, and constraints—then commit to a bold aesthetic direction before coding.

**Critical Focus Areas**:
- Typography: "Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter"
- Color & Theme: Establish cohesive palettes using CSS variables with dominant colors and sharp accents
- Motion: Prioritize high-impact moments like staggered page-load reveals over scattered micro-interactions
- Composition: Embrace asymmetry, overlap, and unexpected layouts that break conventional grids
- Details: Layer textures, gradients, shadows, and decorative elements matching the overall aesthetic

## What to Avoid

The skill explicitly rejects "generic AI-generated aesthetics" including overused typefaces, predictable color schemes, cookie-cutter component patterns, and designs lacking context-specific character.

**Execution Standard**: Match implementation complexity to the vision—maximalist designs warrant elaborate code and extensive effects; minimalist designs demand restraint and precision in spacing and typography.

The underlying philosophy: distinctive, intentional design beats both timid mediocrity and undirected intensity.
